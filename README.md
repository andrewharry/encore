# What is 'encore'?
This library was made to help simplify some challenges with the 'out of the box' .NET Core experience.

I typically see very messy service registrations cluttering up the <code>startup.cs</code> file.
It is often repeative and overtime it tends to become a maintainence problem.

The other challenge **encore** addresses is the issue around EF Core unit testing.
The encore library introduces a range of powerful test classes which make it very easy to populate and query
test data in an in-memory database.

# How do I use it?
At the moment the library is not published to NuGet.  This is the goal of this project.
For now, you should copy the library into your solution and test it out and see if it works for you.

Feedback is welcome.

For examples of it in use - please see the tutorials folder in the solution.
